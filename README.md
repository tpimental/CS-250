# CS-250

  

  Throughout this project, a major piece that played a role in the overall development was the 'user stories'. I needed to gather as much information as possible when first getting these stories and even consult the Product Owner for clarity on some areas. Afterwards, keeping clear and consice records of any implementation of user stories and keeping the rest of the team involved contributed to our success. Allowing the testing team to finalize and check all user story implementations aided in wraping everything together.  

  The approach I take to developing programs, is to first gather as much information about the scope as possible. Next creating a sort of task list, or backlog, is how I can map out what is needed. I use tools to estimate the time to completion for these tasks and set goals for how long they should take. If there are additional participants, mandatory and consistent communication is a must to ensure we succeed. I really hope to incorporate continuous feedback and development into my future works, in order to ensure projects don't turn stale and are always improving. 

	In order to be a ‘good’ team member, just don’t create more work for anyone else. Don’t make your teammates lives more difficult or come to the table with more problems than solutions. Always adhere to good communication guidelines and when things go wrong, never try to sweep them under the rug. People make mistakes, its in our nature. Those who accept them and learn from them are the best teammates.
